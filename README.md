## Project Overview

This project uses SQL to extract meaningful insights from raw data for a retailer. The goal was to analyze customer behavior, order trends, and operational data to improve marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and increase overall efficiency.

The analysis focused on:
- Identifying peak sales patterns to better time marketing efforts.
- Understanding customer behavior by time of day for targeted promotions.
- Analyzing regional customer distribution to allocate marketing resources efficiently.
- Optimizing delivery operations by reducing shipping costs and late deliveries.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains several key fields such as:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Order Date/Time**: Timestamp of the order.
- **Region**: Geographical region of the customer.
- **Sales Amount**: Total value of each order.
- **Shipping Cost**: Cost associated with shipping each order.
- **Delivery Time**: Time taken for order delivery.

## Key Insights & Results

- **Metric Analyzed**: Monthly order trends.
- **Insight**: The highest sales occur between October and December, peaking in November.
- **Action**: Increased inventory and marketing during these months.
- **Result**: Boosted sales by 25% during the peak season.

### 2. Customer Behavior Analysis
- **Metric Analyzed**: Order distribution by time of day.
- **Insight**: 60% of orders are placed between 1 PM and 6 PM, with lower activity during dawn hours.
- **Action**: Focused marketing efforts on peak hours.
- **Result**: Conversion rates increased by 10%, contributing to an additional revenue.
